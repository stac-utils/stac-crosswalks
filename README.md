# STAC Crosswalks (Work in Progress) 

This repo aims to provide some resources for people working to map common metadata formats into STAC. 

If you'd like help mapping a metadata format then open an issue and link to an example record, with all its assets.

Initial list:

* ISO 19115
* US FGDC 
* [DCAT-US](https://resources.data.gov/resources/dcat-us/)

Many existing geospatial metadata standards aren't quite appropriate to STAC, as they really are more to document the 'layer' or 'collection' level, 
like our STAC Collections. But we'll aim to recommend what to do if someone asks to convert from X metadata format to STAC.
